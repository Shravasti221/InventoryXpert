#InventoryXpert
The main idea behind this project: \The sellers can store their goods directly at the godowns and add it to the inventoryXpert database connected to the godown. Then every consumer who visits the godown can view the product and buy it. The money paid by the consumer will directly be added to the producerâ€™s account. So the next time the producer drops by the godown he/she can collect any revenue earned from the sale of his/her products. Multiple consumers and producers can browse/ add items at the same time as long as enough hardware input devices are available as our platform implements multi-threading to create parallel threads for all users present. The godown has only limited space (that is a characteristic of every godown) so if there is no space, any producer trying to add more items will be notified.
